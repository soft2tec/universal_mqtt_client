The soft2tec team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. If you are in doubt on who to contact, we can help. Email security@soft2tec.com and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.
